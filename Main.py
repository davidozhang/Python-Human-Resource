#These functions include:
#Searching
#Retreive save files
#Saving employee files
#deleting an employee
#Adding a new employee
#Changing an associate type to manager
#Changing an manager type to associate

"""
pre: if the files can be read succesfully, the information in the textfiles has to correspond to
     an integer, or a string, depending on which variable it represents.
     e.g. phone number must be an integer, names must be a string
post:The largest Id number is set by reading the first line of workIdNumbers.txt.
     The numbers after that(if any, )represent the textfiles that are supposed to be read by the program.
     e.g. if the textdocument says:
        5
        1
        2
        3
        5
        Then the largest Id number is set to 5
        The text documents that have to be read are 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 5.txt
     Based on those textdocuments, instances of the corresponding employees will be appended to the employeeList
purpose: To read the save files, contained in text documents, into the program
